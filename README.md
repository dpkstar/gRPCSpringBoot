1. Overview:
This documentation outlines the communication flow between the client-side ComLayerService and the server-side OnCloudService using gRPC for sending JSON data.

2. Components:
Client Component (ComLayerService): This component resides on the client-side and is responsible for sending JSON data to the server.
Server Component (OnCloudService): This component resides on the server-side and is responsible for receiving JSON data from the client and processing it.
3. Communication Flow:
Client Initiation (ComLayerService):

The ComLayerService on the client-side initiates the communication by creating a gRPC channel and stub.
It loads the JSON data from the resources and constructs a request.
The client sends the request to the server using the gRPC stub.
Server Reception and Processing (OnCloudService):

The OnCloudService on the server-side receives the gRPC request.
It processes the received JSON data.
The server constructs a response containing the received JSON data.
Client Response Handling (ComLayerService):

The client-side ComLayerService receives the response from the server.
It handles the response and completes the Mono stream with the received JSON data.

4. Diagram:
Below is a diagram illustrating the interaction between the client-side ComLayerService and the server-side OnCloudService:

5. Conclusion:
This documentation provides an overview of how JSON data is sent from the client-side ComLayerService to the server-side OnCloudService using gRPC communication. The communication flow involves initiating the communication from the client, processing the request on the server, and handling the response on the client-side.
